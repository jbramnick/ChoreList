# ChoreList
Chore List Program for CS 430 Software Engineering

This online application will allow users to create an account from which they may create, store, manage, track, and reward completion of various household chores at their convince.

To install your own copy of this software, use the github link provided on the main page of this depository. Then follow the instructions from the second README text file located in the startbootstrap-thumbnail-gallery-gh-pages directory for instructions on how to download the SQL database dependencies. This is required to run the database of the application. Then from the same directory compile and run server.py.
