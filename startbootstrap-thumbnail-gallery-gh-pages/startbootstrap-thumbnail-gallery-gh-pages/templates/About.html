          The chore tracker is intended as a quality of life product for families.
          It will provide a good system for parents to keep up with their children's 
          chores and offer incentives for the children to do them. This will deliver 
          a new experience for parents and children alike 
          and hopefully improve quality of life for the family. With the convenience 
          of the web interface and iOS compatablitiy, along the simplicity of the design
          it will be easy for this product to take hold in families.
