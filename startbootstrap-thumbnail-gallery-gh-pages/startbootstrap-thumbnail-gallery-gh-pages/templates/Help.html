        <strong>Creating Chores</strong><br>
        <p>To create a new chore to store in the database, simple log-in and select the Chores page. From here
        you will simple need to click the add button. This will bring you to a new screen where you 
        will be prompted to enter information such as the name of the chore and it's point value.

          <strong>Passwords</strong><br> 
          When choosing a password, make sure think carefully. If any of your children can figure out your password,
          They will be able to manipulate a large portion of this application, rendering much of it's capabilities pointless.
          As your dealing with those who are familiar to you, it might be good to go above and beyond the usual mix of 8 or
          more numbers and letters. While it would be ill advised to use a password you may have employed on multiple other
          sites, definitely don't use anything too complicated to remember either.
